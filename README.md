## Stadium Modelling
### Version 1
Software Testing Phase. Explore the modelling potential of Unity.ProBuilder. ProBuilder is a powerful plug-in for Unity designed to simplify modelling. To evaluate its capabilities, we created a simple stadium model. Through this test, we gained insight into how ProBuilder performs when dealing with various modelling issues, such as audience seating arrangements and other details. This will provide us with experience for our subsequent development work and help us to use the tool more effectively to create high-quality 3D models.

### Version 2 
The first and second layers of the stadium were built. Considering the symmetrical structure of the arena, I decided to build only the two sides of the model for efficiency and accuracy, which not only ensures the consistency of the model, but also saves a lot of time and resources.
In addition, a staircase design from the first level to the second level was included. It helps to simulate the movement paths of the audience in the arena and provides the basis for subsequent crowd simulation. The stairs are designed with realistic dimensions in mind to ensure that they meet both the standards of real-world use and the needs of the game or simulation application.

### Version 3
The main goal of this version was to complete the first and second levels of the stadium. This meant no longer limiting ourselves to the sides of the model, but making sure that both levels of the entire arena were exhaustively reproduced.
In addition to the basic structure of the arena, the staircases between the first and second levels were optimised to ensure that they would be able to cope with the flow of large numbers of spectators, providing a solid and reliable basis for subsequent development and application.

### Version 4
Modelling the third floor and the roof of the stadium.
Modelling the internal structure of the stadium and add obstacles.
Change the dimensions of the corridors, doors, etc. according to the reality and the needs of other parts of the PROJECT.

## Camera control
Use the space bar to raise the camera, use the control key to lower the camera

## NPC automatic movement
After the game starts, let the NPC move towards the gate.
