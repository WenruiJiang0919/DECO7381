This is a pointer function. The purpose of this function is to help the user to complete the game better, by guiding the user's way forward in the game with arrows, and preventing the user from not being able to find the correct escape route because the model is too big.
First of all, after learning Unity's code, I wanted to design an arrow model by finding materials on the web that correspond to arrows, such as images, lines or Unity materials. In my initial idea, I wanted to generate a large Plane, design a material for the arrow, assign the material to the Plane, and design multiple planes in the scene to be combined to realize the function of the arrow.
